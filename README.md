# Prediction of Used Car Prices
The used goods market is often an informal market and may require knowing your stuff when dealing with such goods. The used car market is a notable example where having information beforehand saves yourself from getting a bad deal in acquiring a car. This is formally known as "Asymmetry of Information".

Given my lack of knowledge within this market, I wondered what could happen if I ever have to purchase my first car without any prior knowledge and thus, creating a model in predicting used vehicle prices helps me learn the used car market and apply machine learning skills to practice.
