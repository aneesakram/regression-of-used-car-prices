# Prediction of Used Car Prices
The used goods market is often an informal market and may require knowing your stuff when dealing with such goods. The used car market is a notable example where having information beforehand saves yourself from getting a bad deal in acquiring a car. This is formally known as "Asymmetry of Information".

Given my lack of knowledge within this market, I wondered what could happen if I ever have to purchase my first car without any prior knowledge and thus, creating a model in predicting used vehicle prices helps me learn the used car market and apply machine learning skills to practice.

### What are we dealing with?
This dataset was taken from a Kaggle competition found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s4e9). This dataset provides information on 188,533 cars on their **brand**,	**model**,	**model_year**,	**mileage**,	**fuel_type**,	**engine**,	**transmission**,	**ext_col**,	**int_col**,	**accident**,	**clean_title** and	**price**.
